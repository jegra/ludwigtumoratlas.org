Tyler Jacks, PhD is the Director of the Ludwig Center at MIT and is a world leader in cancer genetics; he is known for his ground-breaking work on the development of genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Dr. Jacksâ€™s research uses GEMMs to understand the interactions between the immune system and cancer and to translate the finding from mouse cancer models to human cancer to develop therapies to kill cancer cells at metastatic sites and inhibit metastatic spread.
