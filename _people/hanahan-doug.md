Doug Hanahan, PhD is a Distinguished Scholar at the Ludwig Center at Lausanne and is a pioneering molecular biologist and renowned cancer researcher. Dr. Hanahan’s research uses genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of cancer to investigate the molecular mechanisms of multi-step tumorigenesis, in particular invasion, metastasis, and evasive resistance to targeted therapies, and to translate that knowledge into new therapeutic approaches.
