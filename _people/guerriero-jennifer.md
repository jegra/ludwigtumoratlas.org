Jennifer Guerriero, PhD is a PhD immunologist and core member of the Harvard Tissue Atlas Team and the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology and Director of the Breast Immunology Laboratory in the Women's Cancer Program at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The Guerriero laboratory works on unraveling the complexity of TAM biology, ontogeny and metabolic regulation with the goal of developing clinically effective strategies to target TAMs to promote T-cell activation and weaken the immune-suppressive TME to improve immunotherapy response rates. Dr. Guerriero also serves as the Director of the Breast Tumor Immunology Laboratory (BTIL) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The focus of the translational research in the BTIL is to investigate innovated methods to modulate the immune response in breast cancer as well as to better understand the mechanistic basis for sensitivity and resistance to currently available immunotherapies.
