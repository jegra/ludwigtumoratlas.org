Jennifer Guerriero, PhD is a core member of the Harvard Tissue Atlas Team and the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology and Director of the Breast Immunology Laboratory in the Women’s Cancer Program at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Her research focuses on unraveling the complexity of tissue associated macrophages (TAMs). She and her group study the functions, regulation, and developmental identities of TAMs and perform basic science and translational experiments aimed at identifying clinically effective strategies for targeting TAMs, thereby promoting T-cell activation and weakening the immune-suppressive properties of the tumor microenvironment.
