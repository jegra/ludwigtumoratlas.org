Joan Brugge, PhD is the Director of the  Ludwig Center at Harvard and is a renowned expert in cancer biology and the fundamental mechanisms of cancer growth and progression, in breast, ovarian, and other cancer types. Dr. Brugge’s research provides essential insight into understanding the earliest changes that occur in the evolution of breast cancer in women at high risk due to inherited genetic alterations. This involves generating an atlas of the landscape of human and mouse mammary tissues using a variety of single cell technologies including CyCIF. Dr. Brugge's lab is also interested in resistance mechanisms by which tumor cells escape the impact of cancer therapy to allow us to develop new strategies which can overcome resistance and significantly improve current and emerging cancer therapies.
