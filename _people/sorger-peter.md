Peter Sorger, PhD is Director of its [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/) (LSP), where most of the work for the Ludwig Tumor Atlas Project is based. Dr. Sorger’s research focuses on two main areas of research: the study of the genomic instability that underlies cancer; and a systems approach to charting mammalian cell signaling and response to anti-cancer drugs. As Principle Investigator of the Ludwig Tumor Atlas Project, Dr. Sorger leads the construction of a multi-dimensional “tumor map” that captures the locations and identities of cancerous, noncancerous, immune, and supporting cells that contribute to tumor evolution, progression and response to therapies.
