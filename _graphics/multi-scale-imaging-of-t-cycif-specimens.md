**(A)** Schematic of the cyclic process whereby t-CyCIF images are assembled via multiple rounds of four-color imaging. **(B)** Bright-field H&E image of a metastasectomy specimen that includes a large metastatic melanoma lesion and adjacent benign tissue. The H&E staining was performed after the same specimen had undergone t-CyCIF. **(C)** Representative t-CyCIF staining of the specimen shown in **(A)** stitched together using the Ashlar software from 165 successive CyteFinder fields using a 20X/0.8NA objective **(D)** One field from **(B)** at the tumor-normal junction demonstrating staining for S100-postive malignant cells, Î±-SMA positive stroma, T lymphocytes (positive for CD3, CD4 and CD8), and the proliferation marker phospho-RB (pRB). **(E)** A melanoma imaged on a GE INCell Analyzer 6000 confocal microscope to demonstrate sub-cellular and sub-organelle structures. **(F)** Staining of a melanoma sample using the OMX Blaze structured illumination microscope with a 60x/1.42NA objective. **(G)** Staining of a patient-derived mouse xenograft breast tumor using the OMX Blaze showing a spindle in a mitotic cell.
