title: Profiling resistance in BRAF/MEK therapy in melanoma GEMM specimens (Ludwig Branch at Lausanne)


abstract: Dr. Doug Hanahan at the Ludwig Branch at Lausanne and the Swiss Cancer Center Leman is leading a project to better understand determinants of therapeutic response in melanoma. These studies focus on genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMM) of melanoma and human samples from clinical trials. Melanomas carrying mutations in the BRAF kinases are initially responsive to treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors but resistance frequently arises both in human patients and mouse models.  In GEMMs resistance is driven by a specific modification in a transmembrane receptor. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance may provide new avenues for increasing the durability of response to existing therapies.
