title: Tumor-immune interaction in mouse models of lung and pancreatic cancer (Ludwig Center at MIT)

status:

abstract: Dr. Tyler Jacks at the Ludwig Center at MIT is leading a project using multiplexed tissue imaging to develop high-definition spatial maps of tumor-immune interactions in genetically engineered mouse models of lung and pancreatic cancer. These innovative experimental models recapitulate the type of crosstalk that is common in tumor formation, with tumor cells under pressure to develop avoidance strategies that permit evasion from immune cell attack. In-depth analysis of murine models of cancer is needed to develop an understanding of the mechanisms that shape the tumor microenvironment > only animal models have the necessary manipulability and reproducibility for causal, mechanistic studies.
