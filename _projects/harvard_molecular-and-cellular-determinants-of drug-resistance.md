title: Molecular and cellular determinants of drug resistance (Ludwig Center at Harvard)

status:

abstract: Over a dozen investigators at the Ludwig Center at Harvard are using spatial profiling methods to study the molecular and cellular determinants of drug resistance in solid tumors. Despite extraordinary advances in cancer therapeutics, most patients eventually relapse and succumb to disease due to the development of drug resistance. The problem of resistance is complicated by tumor heterogeneity both within an individual tumor and among tumors located at different sites in the same patient. Tumors and their microenvironments are also plastic, changing through the course of disease and in response to drugs. Spatial profiling of human specimens acquired in the course of patient care and research clinical trials provides a unique opportunity to better understand how heterogeneity at different spatial scales promotes drug resistance.
