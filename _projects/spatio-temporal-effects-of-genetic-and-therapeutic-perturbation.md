title: Spatio-temporal effects of genetic and therapeutic perturbation on the immune microenvironment in murine models of lung and pancreatic adenocarcinomas (manuscript in preparation)

abstract: In a collaboration with Dr. Tyler Jacks at Ludwig MIT, we used t-CyCIF to characterize tumor intrinsic and extrinsic states in genetically engineered cancer models of lung and pancreas samples treated with clinical trial agents such as HSP90 inhibitors, classic cytotoxic agents, and immune checkpoint blockade modifiers. We are interested in understanding the effects of genetic perturbations, such as targeted deletion or over-expression of immune-related genes, in these samples.
