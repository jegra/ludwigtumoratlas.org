title: Spatiotemporal analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment within human primary and metastatic prostate cancer (Ludwig Center at the University of Chicago)

abstract: Dr. Akash Patnaik at the Ludwig Center at the University of Chicago is focused on understanding why only ~10-25% of metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients respond to these therapies targeting immune checkpoint proteins such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1. The reasons for this are thought to lie in the composition and organization of the tumor immune microenvironment. The properties of the tumor micro-environment primary versus metastatic prostate cancer are therefore being studied to better understand how tumor-immune interactions change as a function of disease progression. We hope that this will lead to discovery of new resistance mechanisms and targets for therapeutic intervention.

# Spatiotemporal analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment within human primary and metastatic prostate cancer

The primary goal of this collaboration is to use multiplex t-CycIF technology to examine the tumor immune microenvironment in primary and metastatic prostate cancer tissue specimens. Furthermore, we will take a “deep dive” to spatiotemporally analyze the dynamic changes within the tumor immune microenvironment, using baseline and on-treatment metastatic biopsies from immune-oncology clinical trials. T-CycIF superimposes serial tissue stains to produce highly multiplexed images at a single-cell level with intact tissue architecture. Demarcation of single cells & epitope detection allows for advanced cell phenotyping and tissue segmentation of specimens into regions of interest including tumor area, tumor border and surrounding stroma. Precise localization of individual cells enables quantitative spatial analysis including cell density calculations, proximity and nearest-neighbor analyses. Application of advanced computational methods, including deep machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, could identify novel architectural patterns within the tumor immune microenvironment, leading to the development of novel response/resistance biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.

Primary prostate cancer samples were obtained from prostatectomies in patients with localized prostate cancer, across a spectrum of combined Gleason scores ranging from 6-10. Metastatic prostate cancer samples were obtained from baseline and on-treatment with rucaparib (PARP inhibitor) and nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) in mCRPC patients enrolled in a Phase Ib investigator-initiated clinical trial. Comparison of primary versus metastatic tissue specimens will reveal site-specific differences, while comparison of baseline and on-treatment metastatic samples will detect changes-related to PARP and PD-1 inhibitor treatment. In addition, we will accrue 50 paired metastatic biopsy samples from a combination Phase II trial of cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with nivolumab in mCRPC patients.
