title: Spatiotemporal analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment within human primary and metastatic prostate cancer (Ludwig Center at the University of Chicago)

abstract: Dr. Akash Patnaik at the Ludwig Center at the University of Chicago is focused on understanding why only ~10-25% of metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients respond to these therapies targeting immune checkpoint proteins such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1. The reasons for this are thought to lie in the composition and organization of the tumor immune microenvironment. The properties of the tumor micro-environment primary versus metastatic prostate cancer are therefore being studied to better understand how tumor-immune interactions change as a function of disease progression. We hope that this will lead to discovery of new resistance mechanisms and targets for therapeutic intervention.
