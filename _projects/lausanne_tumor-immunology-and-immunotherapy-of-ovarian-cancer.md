title: Tumor immunology and immunotherapy of ovarian cancer (Ludwig Branch at Lausanne)

status: Manuscript in press

abstract: This project, led by Dr. George Coukos at the Ludwig Branch at Lausanne and the University of Lausanne, focuses on understanding how ovarian cancers evade detection by the immune system. The goal is to develop new drugs, combination of existing drugs, and predictive biomarkers that enable the use of immunotherapy in ovarian cancer and achieve long-term remission in patients. In the first phase of this work we have found that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes engaged by cognate antigen upregulate PD-1, which restrains their effectiveness. These cells receive CD28 co-stimulation in distinctive intraepithelial niches where they express a range of TCR-engaged and exhausted states. Following PD-1 blockade (with therapeutic antibodies), activation of TILs still requires CD28 co-stimulation. Exhausted TILs, in a state of TCR engagement but without proper CD28 co-stimulation by  antigen presenting cells do not fully benefit from PD-1 blockade.
