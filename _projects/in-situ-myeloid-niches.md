title: In situ myeloid niches support antitumor T-Cells and enable PD-1 blockade via CD28 costimulation

status: Manuscript submitted

abstract: In a collaboration with Dr. George Coukos at Ludwig Lausanne, we performed t-CyCIF on and to investigate PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in ovarian cancer samples. We found that the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction was mostly occurring between myeloid cells and CD8+T-cells. However, as the patients were treated with the combination of PARP and PD-1 inhibitor, the most significant contributor to response to therapy was signature 3 positive tumor cells and their proximity to PD-1 positive exhausted CD8+T-cells.
