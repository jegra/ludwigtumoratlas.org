title: A phase Ib/II study of Rucaparib (PARP inhibitor) combined with Nivolumab in primary and metastatic prostate cancer (samples received)

abstract: In a collaboration with Dr. Akash Patnaik at Ludwig Chicago, we have used t-CyCIF to profile the tumor intrinsic and extrinsic immune responses in pre- and post-treatment prostate cancer samples to compare responders vs. non-responders. A primary aim of this collaboration is to characterize site-specific differences in primary vs metastatic prostate cancer to better understand the changes to the tumor microenvironment.
