title: Profiling resistance in BRAF/MEK therapy in melanoma GEMM specimens

status: Specimens received

abstract: In a collaboration with Dr. Doug Hanahan at Ludwig Lausanne, we are exploring for using t-CyCIF to better understand determinants of therapeutic response in melanoma. We have recently received genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) specimens for profiling with t-CyCIF and expect to receive human samples as well. Resistance to BRAF/MEK therapy in the GEMM model is driven by a specific modification in a transmembrane receptor that may be amendable to analysis using network analysis tools developed in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology.
