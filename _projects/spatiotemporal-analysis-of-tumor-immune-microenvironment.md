title: Spatiotemporal analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment within human primary and metastatic prostate cancer

status: Specimens processed

abstract: Over the past decade, there has been a resurgent interest in cancer immunotherapy, based on the profound and durable clinical responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 in a subset of patients across a range of malignancies. However, only approximately 10-25% of metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients respond to these approaches. Therefore, a deeper insight into the tumor immune microenvironment in human primary and metastatic disease is critical for discovery of resistance mechanisms and new targets for therapeutic intervention. In a collaboration with Dr. Akash Patnaik at the University of Chicago Ludwig Center, we have used a highly multiplexed single-cell immunofluoresecence using tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CycIF), to profile the architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of primary and metastatic prostate cancers. A major goal of this collaboration is to characterize site-specific differences in primary versus metastatic prostate cancer, to better understand the changes within the tumor immune microenvironment as a function of disease progression. This method also allows for advanced spatiotemporal analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment, with a particular focus on pre-treatment and on-treatment metastatic biopsy samples from immune-oncology clinical trials. Furthermore, application of novel computational methods, which include deep-machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, and correlation with clinical responses, will lead to the identification of novel response and/or resistance biomarkers and therapeutic targets for treatment of this devastating disease.

# Spatiotemporal analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment within human primary and metastatic prostate cancer

The primary goal of this collaboration is to use multiplex t-CycIF technology to examine the tumor immune microenvironment in primary and metastatic prostate cancer tissue specimens. Furthermore, we will take a “deep dive” to spatiotemporally analyze the dynamic changes within the tumor immune microenvironment, using baseline and on-treatment metastatic biopsies from immune-oncology clinical trials. T-CycIF superimposes serial tissue stains to produce highly multiplexed images at a single-cell level with intact tissue architecture. Demarcation of single cells & epitope detection allows for advanced cell phenotyping and tissue segmentation of specimens into regions of interest including tumor area, tumor border and surrounding stroma. Precise localization of individual cells enables quantitative spatial analysis including cell density calculations, proximity and nearest-neighbor analyses. Application of advanced computational methods, including deep machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, could identify novel architectural patterns within the tumor immune microenvironment, leading to the development of novel response/resistance biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. 

Primary prostate cancer samples were obtained from prostatectomies in patients with localized prostate cancer, across a spectrum of combined Gleason scores ranging from 6-10. Metastatic prostate cancer samples were obtained from baseline and on-treatment with rucaparib (PARP inhibitor) and nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) in mCRPC patients enrolled in a Phase Ib investigator-initiated clinical trial. Comparison of primary versus metastatic tissue specimens will reveal site-specific differences, while comparison of baseline and on-treatment metastatic samples will detect changes-related to PARP and PD-1 inhibitor treatment. In addition, we will accrue 50 paired metastatic biopsy samples from a combination Phase II trial of cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with nivolumab in mCRPC patients.
