# About

Drug resistance is the single greatest challenge facing contemporary cancer therapy. Despite extraordinary advances in 
cancer therapeutics, most patients eventually relapse and succumb to disease due to the development of drug resistance. 
The problem of resistance is complicated by tumor heterogeneity, both within an individual tumor and among tumors located 
at different sites in the same patient. Tumors and their microenvironments are also plastic, changing through the course of 
disease and in response to drugs. Multiplexed tissue imaging technologies and single-cell genomics allow us to characterize 
this heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. 

The Ludwig Tumor Atlas project brings together investigators from across the U.S. and Europe to investigate the basis of 
intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti-cancer drugs and to develop therapies for overcoming resistance.
